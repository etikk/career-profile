          This game was created for the kood/J천hvi div-01 task "make-your-game". The aim
          of the task was to create a clone of a classic, with Javascript and CSS and
          without using the canvas object or any external packages. The task focused on
          DOM manipulation, using RequestAnimationFrame and maintaining a steady 60fps at
          all times. To get a steady playing experience on different monitors, frame
          throttling was added. The aim of the game is to move around and blow up enemies
          with bombs. The game is played with the arrow keys and the spacebar. The game
          must be able to be stopped and started again without significant frame drops.
          The most difficult part was writing collision detection and smooth movement
          around corners. For smooth animation, a sprite image containing all different
          movements is moved with CSS under a virtual hole in the given layer.{" "}
